## About me
Hi! My name is **Ayaan Imran**, but I like to be called **"Analoger"** in the digital world. I am currently 14 years old. I am and have been currently living in Kuwait for my entire life. From childhood, I always gravitated towards the "tech side" of everything. I am a _self taught_ student and I think of myself
as an "intermediate" in programming. 

## What programming language do I use?
I mostly code in python. It is an amazing programming language. I have been coding in this language for over 3 years now! However, I find myself coding in various other languages
for certain tasks; for example, when I need to present a project in school, I need to code a website. I don't really code websites that well ðŸ’©ðŸ˜”.

## My side tech related hobbies
- I really like video editing and grapghic designing, but not as much as I like programming ðŸ’–. I use a mobile app called "kinemaster", so it is abvious I use it as a hobby ðŸ˜†
- Another thing I found interest in recently is a piece of hardware called "arduino". It is really cool; it allows you to control a plathera of electrical components with the help of coding (in c++).
